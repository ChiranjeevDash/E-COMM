E-COM Website: Technical Architecture (v2
)
1. Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a simple, responsive e-commerce SPA
.
Built as a single
HTML file, it simulates a multi-page experience by dynamically showing and hiding content sections.
Core functionalities include:
A product catalog
A persistent shopping cart
A mock "My Orders" panel
A multi-step checkout flow (cart, payment, confirmation)
A customer review submission form
2. Tech Stack
Frontend (UI)
: HTML & Tailwind CSS
Business Logic & State: Vanilla JavaScript
Data (Backend Simulation)
: Hardcoded JavaScript c
onst arrays
Assets: Inline Base64-encoded SVGs for reliable, dependency-free graphics
3. Rationale
This stack was chosen for its simplicity and zero-setup deployment (runs in any browser)
. Inline SVGs
guarantee asset reliability, and c
onst arrays simulate a lightweight backend.
JavaScript manages all state, which is split into:
1. Data State: A
cart array, persisted in lo
calStorage.
2. UI State: Helper functions (showMainStore()
simulate page navigation.
, etc.
) toggle the visibility of <div> sections to

Architecture Breakdown
1. HTML Structure
The <b
ody> contains a persistent <header> and several primary content <div> wrappers: #main-
c
ontent (products, reviews, footer)
, #payment-page , and #
c
onfirmation-page. UI state functions
hide or show these wrappers as needed.
Additional modal <div> elements (
#
cart-modal , #orders-
modal , #loading-overlay) are used for slide-out panels and overlays.
2. JavaScript Logic (
<script>
)
Data:
c
onst PRODUCTS and c
onst ORDERS arrays define all site data.
State: let cart = [] holds the live shopping cart.

Initialization (On Page Load)
: loadCartFromStorage() runs first, followed by functions to
render products (renderProducts())
, the cart (renderCart())
, orders (renderOrders())
, and
the review form dropdown (populateReviewProducts()) to build the initial UI.
Core Functions:
Rendering: A set of render...() functions (e.g.
, renderProducts()
over the data/state arrays to generate and inject HTML.
, renderCart())
loop
State & Actions: Functions like addToCart()
, updateCartQuantity()
, and
removeFromCart() modify the cart array. saveCartToStorage() persists these changes
to lo
calStorage.
UI Management: toggle...Modal() functions handle the slide-out panels.
showMainStore()
, showPaymentPage()
, and showConfirmationPage() manage the main
"page" visibility.
Event Listeners:
Event delegation is used on #product-grid and #
cart-items to manage clicks on dynamic
content.
Listeners on header buttons and forms trigger the modal, review, and checkout functions.
Checkout Flow: A series of click handlers guides the user from #
chec
kout-
showPaymentPage()
>
-
#pay-now-
b
utton -
> showConfirmationPage()
-
showMainStore()
, clearing the cart after the simulated payment.
